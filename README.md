The package serves as an interface to work with relational Database, by do the following actions :

* Visualize your data
* Add tables
* Add variables
* Manage Access 

## Motivation 

We were inspired by the article of  [Yu Day](https://shanghai.hosting.nyu.edu/data/r/case-4-database-management-shiny.html) and thought maybe this can used internally. 
However the script was not available, and also important features were missing. 
Thus, we have build our own Database manager GUI using [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) framework. 
Recently we have decided to make the GUI as an open source package

# Main features
